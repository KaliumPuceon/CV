\section*{Personal Profile}

I am a qualified electrical engineer currently working in the field of embedded systems and
automation. I am interested in taking on a wide variety of engineering challenges and I can leverage
my academic knowledge and additional skills to learn about and approach a wide array of problems. I
am presently working towards a masters degree in nanoelectronics at the University of Johannesburg,
with a focus on graphene nanosensors, and I am eager to expand my skills and knowledge with regards
to nanoelectronic systems. I am also interested in general electronic design, particularly embedded
system design, and I have several years of experience working with Linux systems, both on desktop
and with high performance computing clusters. I can effectively combine these skills to take on
problems from multiple directions.
