# My CV
Hi, this is my CV and associated documents pack. It's to be considered up to
date as of the most recent commit, unless I leave a note saying it's not for
some reason.

## Transcript
`transcript.pdf` is my unofficial academic transcript from UCT, which should be
everything you need to see how well (or poorly) I'm doing at my classes.

## Contacting me
There's several email addresses you could contact me at, and the two most
official looking ones are on the CV itself. There's also a phone number, which
might be useful but email is probably the best bet.

## What I can do for you!
I can do some programming! Hopefully you're here because you want me to do some
programming for you. I'm also currently studying as a computer engineer, so once
that's out of the way I'll be qualified to make the bits that you can program on
and *_also_ program those, so that's cool.

## Why is this in latex?
This is in really, really simple latex. Simple enough that you could read it in
a raw text editor if you had to. I considered writing it in markdown and having
some clever scripts to convert it to a handful of formats but also, no. Between
latex and PDF, this should be viewable by basically any computer, even if not
very easily. The latex is intentionally low on custom formatting to keep it easy
to build, you shouldn't need dependencies to hire me.
