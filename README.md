# My CV
Hi, this is my CV and associated documents pack. It's to be considered up to
date as of the most recent commit, unless I leave a note here saying it's not
for some reason.

## Transcript and Certificate
`certificate.pdf` is my certificate of qualification as an engineer, and
`transcript.pdf` is my unofficial academic transcript from UCT, which should be
everything you need to convince yourself that I'm a real engineer, and see how
well (or poorly) I did in my classes.

## Contacting me
There's several email addresses associated with this GitHub you could contact me
at, and the two most official looking ones are on the CV itself.

## What I can do for you: A summary
I'm currently working in Embedded System Development, which includes writing
edge software for an embedded Linux system and maintaining and upgrading that
embedded Linux image. I also come up with hardware solutions for sensing and
control problems. I'm studying towards a Masters degree in Nanoelectronics at
the University of Johannesburg, part-time, with a research focus on graphene
manufacturing techniques for biosesnsors.I have a penchant for Linux and Linux
Admin, in particular working with high performance cluster computers, but I
could also work with a desktop Linux fleet.

## Why is this in latex?
This is in really, really simple latex. Simple enough that you could read it in
a raw text editor if you had to. I considered writing it in markdown and having
some clever scripts to convert it to a handful of formats but also, no. Between
latex and PDF, this should be viewable by basically any computer, even if not
very easily. The latex is intentionally low on custom formatting to keep it easy
to build, you shouldn't need dependencies to hire me.
