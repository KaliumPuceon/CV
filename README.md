# My CV
Hi, this is my CV and associated documents pack. It's to be considered up to
date as of the most recent commit, unless I leave a note saying it's not for
some reason.

## Transcript
`transcript.pdf` is my unofficial academic transcript from UCT, which should be
everything you need to see how well (or poorly) I'm doing at my classes.

## Contacting me
There's several email addresses associated with this GitHub you could contact me
at, and the two most official looking ones are on the CV itself.

## What I can do for you: A summary
I'm currently studying as a computer engineer, so once that's out of the way
I'll be qualified to make the bits that you can program on and _also_ program
those, so that's neat. I can also do some programming! Hopefully you're here
because you want me to do some programming for you. I have a penchant for Linux
and Linux Admin, in particular working with cluster computers.

## Why is this in latex?
This is in really, really simple latex. Simple enough that you could read it in
a raw text editor if you had to. I considered writing it in markdown and having
some clever scripts to convert it to a handful of formats but also, no. Between
latex and PDF, this should be viewable by basically any computer, even if not
very easily. The latex is intentionally low on custom formatting to keep it easy
to build, you shouldn't need dependencies to hire me.
